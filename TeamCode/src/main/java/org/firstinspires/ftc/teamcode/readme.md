## TeamCode Module
This is where all the Bunyips (FTC Team 15215) Java-based code will reside!  
Feel free to have a look around and steal any of our code.  
It's likely already stolen from elsewhere unless mentioned.

## Class prefix naming convention
Bunyips : Official code used and maintained by us  
Concept : Code that has been imported or written by us but not maintained anymore (deprecated/superseded code etc)    
Test : Semi-maintained code designed to help us test something on our robot (velocity, encoder readings etc)  
Reference : Code that will not work on our robot (because of imports or old code and etc) but we keep to refer back to vital concepts  
  
'Bunyips' designated classes use '<>' in their Driver Station name declaration
