## TeamCode Module
This is where all the Bunyips (FTC Team 15215) Java-based code will reside!  
Feel free to have a look around and steal any of our code.  
It's likely already stolen from elsewhere unless mentioned.

## Class prefix naming convention
All OpModes use '<robot name(+ -I if independent class)> OpMode name' in their Driver Station name declaration to avoid confusion.
Classes are organised based on their package name and should only be run on their respective robot.
'_independent' packages do not rely on common packages and can be run without the need of external classes.
